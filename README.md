# Surf's Up Analysis

## Overview
The purpose of this analysis is to analyze and present formatted data pertaining to the temperature, precipitation, and weather readings in Oahu so as to
aid decision making vis-a-vis a Surf n' Slurp to be opened in the aforementioned location.

## Results
- We can clearly identify a trend in weather, most notably that June has the (traditionally) best weather conditions for this business
- Precipitation is definitively a non-factor for the majority of the year, with sparse rainfall occuring most commonly in colder months
- Minimum temperatures year round consistantly remain above the ~55-60F threshold at which people consider swimming actively uncomfortable

## Summary
Overall, it would seem that the high temperatures, small portion of rainy days, and ample weather data to base those statement off of present an
excellent environment in which to open a Surfing and Ice Cream shop. The main business pressures that will influence the success of the shop will
not be weather - rather, they will most likely be the saturation of similar shops due to the aforementinoed ideal business conditions.
